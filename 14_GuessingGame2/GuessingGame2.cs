In Chapter 4, you created a program that generates a random number, allows a user to guess it, and 
displays a message indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. Now, create a 
modified program called **GuessingGame2** in which the user can continue to enter values until the 
correct guess is made. After the user guesses correctly, display the number of guesses made.

Recall that you can generate a random number whose value is at least min and less than max using 
the following statements:
```cs
Random ranNumber = new Random();
int randomNumber;
randomNumber = ranNumber.Next(min, max);
```
